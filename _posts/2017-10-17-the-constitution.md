Today we started our meeting by going through our constitution and adjusting anything that needed to be reviewed by everyone in the club. We are working towards becoming a legitimate
student organization and we are quite close! Just a couple more hoops to jump through and we'll be good to go! Once we are a legitimate student org, I will connect with the necessary
people to make sure that this web page is linked from the UNI's [student org website](https://cgi.access.uni.edu/cgi-bin/student_orgs/student_orgs.cgi). Speaking of this website, we
now have a domain name! Thanks to Eric for coming up with the brilliant name of www.UNIDoMath.com. This will be the official domain going forward!

We then took the time to discuss the officer's roles as well as what responsibilities each officer holds. We agreed upon the club rule that an officer can only hold an office position
for two years max (although I think all of the current officers, including myself, will be gone before then). We're protecting future generations from tyranny!

We also come to an important decision regarding the ratification of anything in the constitution.  In order for anything to be ratified, we will need a majority of the club to be
in attendance at which point we will take a vote. In order for change to occur, we need the majority to agree and also we need two officers to sign off.

Finally, we came up with a meeting schedule. We will be meeting every first Wednesday and third Thursday of each month (at 6 pm). This, we hope, will allow everyone to attend. Once the
constitution is finalized and submitted, it will be included in the sidebar of this website. Our next meeting is Wednesday, November 8th at 6:00PM in the math lounge (WRT 338).

## SET TOURNAMENT
Yes, there will be a set tournament. I'm aiming for Halloween at around 6pm. I'm going to whip up the promotional poster this weekend with all the information (which will get posted on this site),
and then come Monday I will spread the word. The winner might just get some candy, unless it's Dr. Stanley...

I leave you with a sweet gif of the Pythagorean Theorem:
