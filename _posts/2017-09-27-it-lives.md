Yes, friends, after a long hiatus the math club is back in full force! Some updates on who holds office positions.
- President:	Eric (and new!)
- Vice-President:	Cam
- Treasurer:	Daniel
- Secretary:	Justice (me)

After clearing up who holds what positions, we went straight into discussing some of the events we want to tackle this year as part of our ventures. We managed to put together a rough outline
- We hope to launch a fundraiser for the student lounge. In tandem with this, we hope to have a pi-day event on March 14th where we sell pies for fundraising.
- I'm planning a set tournament in **October** (more on that in a bit!)
- Tessa, Crystal, and Jason are putting together a <10-minute informal colloquium where we listen to professors (and students) research. This is planned for **November**
- Eric is leading the charge on coordinating a game night in **December**

This brings us to the end of 2017. We also had some more ideas that we spitballed that were put on the backburner for later
- Centimarathon (like a marathon, but like a lot less, for us math people).
- Campus-wide math based scavenger hunt
- Garage sale
- a separate fundraiser for art in the student lounge.
- someone threw out a very ambitious plan to travel to New York to visit the math museum
- Pie run fundraiser (being spearheaded by Zach)

After that, we lined up a few more responsibilities. Tessa will be going into the various Freshman/Sophmore classes in order to recruit some young blood to our barracks. Aside from that, Jake
is working to find out what we need in our constitution to become a formal organization.

## Things for discussion next time:
- T-shirts. Everyone wants them
- Creating a Facebook page (do you want me to do so since I'm the secretary?)
- All things math

Let's talk about [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game))! I'll be holding a set tournament in October, we'll have a double elimination tournament and then some additional festivities for when we all inevitably get lit up by Dr. Stanley.
The winner might just get a prize! (they probably will). I plan on creating flyers which will later be posted on this site. I'd love some assistance in spreading them around campus! I'll keep everyone 
posted when a date is finalized for the tournament.

Our next meeting is within the next two weeks in Rod Library! Feel free to stop by, even if you aren't a math major. We'd love to have you swing by! If there's anything you want to be posted on this website,
let me know! (or if you're a computer nerd, open a PR for the repo). That is all, see you at the next meeting. I leave you with a math riddle:

"An athlete is able to jump FOREVER. However, everytime that she jumps she gets a bit more tired, and every jump goes 1/2 as far as her prior jump. Now, for her very first jump, she goes 1/2 of a foot.
On her second jump, she goes 1/4 of a foot, and so on and so forth. The beginning of her journey is shown in the gif below. How many jumps does it take for her to travel 1 foot?"
