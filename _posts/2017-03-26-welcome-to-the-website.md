This website will be updated after every Math Club meeting (going forward). As the secretary, this feels like the most efficient way for me to
take notes and keep everyone updated. I will also plug any relevant information necessary on this site. Feel free to e-mail me at <adamsjal@uni.edu>
with suggestions for the site/or if you want anything specific on here. Alternatively, if you're a computer person, feel free to open a PR
for the [repo](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Math-Club-Website). For what it's worth, I also plan on keeping the home page updated with our next meeting time so anyone can hop on and see when the
meetings will take place. I'll see you at the next gathering!
