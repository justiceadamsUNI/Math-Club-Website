I was not able to make it to the last meeting, but I did speak to Eric and a couple others so I'll sum up what happened. 
We took the time to finish the constitution and in the process, discussed how we will receive funding and set a few
laws about how meetings will be conducted. After that, everyone simply played games together!

The application to become an official student organization has been sent it. We will now have to schedule a formal meeting
with the NISG to become official. We'll talk about this more next meeting, which is Thursday, Nov 16th from 6:00-:7:00 pm
in Wright 338. See you all there!
