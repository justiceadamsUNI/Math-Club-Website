We are now an official student organization! We now have the ability to apply for funding from student government, to use meeting rooms in the Union for free, and to table in the Union. You can view your organization at [this link](https://cgi.access.uni.edu/cgi-bin/student_orgs/student_orgs.cgi?oid=9460). During our meeting tonight not too much happened. There was very few of us so we sat around and played games. 
Me and Tessa crushed it playing codenames Hopefully, next time we'll have enough people to order some pizza! Remember we won't be meeting again this semester since on the third wednesday of this month we'll be on break.

Good luck with finals and have a good holiday break! See you next semester
